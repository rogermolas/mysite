My name is Roger Molas. I'm a Freelance [ iOS Developer](https://github.com/rogermolas). This** blog, its content, thoughts and opinions are my own.** I blog about technology, code, iOS development, Swift, Objective C and anything related to that. I'm excited about, innovation, community, social equity, stocks and entrepreneurship.

Started programming at high school with BASIC and C, from there i got engaged with programming and explore everything related to bit and bytes. I started iOS development with Objective-C in 2010, published 4 applications on the app store [ the old blog](http://infotechcreations.blogspot.com/p/apps.html).

2012 from the province I moved to central business district to continue  exploring, growing and learning things.
